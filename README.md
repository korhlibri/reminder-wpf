# Reminder
A simple reminder app written in C# using WPF.

## Run
The program can be ran or compiled using dotnet:
```
dotnet run
...
dotnet build
```
Alternatively, you can find the binary in the release version. Please note that the release version links and combines multiple dynamic libraries from .NET and therefore the file size is large. It is advisable to install .NET version 8.0 or greater and build/run from source.
